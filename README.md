## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m Muhammed Hadhil — a Unity Developer passionate about VR simulations, XR tooling, and immersive training experiences.

I love building more than just apps — I focus on spotting real-world problems and turning them into practical solutions. Whether it’s:

🕹 Designing VR training simulations for pharma & medical industries.

🛠 Creating custom Unity XR tools (like a Grab Pose Recorder that saves hours of setup time).

📱 Building side projects like QuickQR, a mobile app that helps gig workers instantly show their UPI QR codes.

I believe great developers aren’t just coders — they’re problem-solvers, innovators, and builders. That mindset drives me to keep learning, experimenting, and creating impactful experiences.
